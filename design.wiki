== basic problem ==
=== Language ===
Python 3

Python is my most familar language, and I try to move on to Python 3.

=== Codec ===
- H.264

I have most matrial about H.264.

- H.261

H.261 is simplest, and easy to implement. And all codec after H.261 still based on block-compressed algorithm. So its main idea do NOT change.
